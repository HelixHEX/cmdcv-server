January was insane (in a good way)üòÅ. Here are my statistics for people who are curious. Thank you as always for the support! 

This month I:
‚Ä¢ Finished my internship
‚Ä¢ Got promoted to junior web dev
‚Ä¢ Made my first online money
‚Ä¢ Went back to uni
‚Ä¢ Hit 15k followers! https://t.co/veF3CBpGM0
If Spiderman worked in tech, would he be a web developer?
Changing my LinkedIn from 'trainee web developer' to 'parttime web developer' feels amazing. 10 out of 10.
Had my first full day at uni today. The first time in about a year.

I had a briefing with a client and two classes about how to do user research &amp; what personas are.

I love learning new stuff üéâ
How do you cheer up a sad JavaScript developer?

You 'Console' them!
I personally think most educational books are crazily overpriced. 

Sorry, but I'm not spending ‚Ç¨30 - ‚Ç¨50 for literature about a topic that will be considered outdated in 2 years time üíÄ
Switching from working on backend development for 5 months to user experience design is a huge change. It takes a whole different way of thinking.
You know what's nice about traveling by train to uni for an hour every day? You have time to read.

I'm really trying to make getting up at 6 am every day a positive thing üòÇ
Want to get into Linux? Check Linux Unhatched. 

It will only take 8 hours to learn the basics. Give it a try and see if Linux is something you like! üôå

I often fill out questionnaires for research about IT students.

9/10 times I get the question "here's a list of 50 popular tech companies among students. Which company would you want to work for?"

Idc which, as long as they pay me fairly, allow hybrid work and are ethical üíÄ
I'm still surprised every day about how much awesomeness someone can create by just knowing how to code.

So much potential. So many possibilities.
I was looking at the technology section at the bookshop today. There was this kid of around 14 with his dad looking around as well.

The kid said to his dad "I don't want a book about just C#, because C# is boring!"

Oh the youth üòÇ
Why did the robot cross the road?
Because it was programmed by a chicken.
Bought some new books ü§©. I think it's very important to support local bookshops, especially now with COVID.

If you're ever around Rotterdam, I would really recommend visiting @donnerboeken. Honestly one of my favourite spots. https://t.co/LyMMlZlN9Y
The Netherlands is no longer in lockdown since Wednesday! Which means that I can actually do stuff outside of the house this weekend.
I bought a new laptop for myself, both for gaming and coding.  I can't wait until it arrives. https://t.co/w1lfGmX38T
Am I the only developer on Tech Twitter that wouldn't enjoy working remotely fulltime? I would go insane working from home 32 to 40 hours a week.
Finishing up my last day as a web development intern üòé https://t.co/NhS6n586PV
Sometimes I'm surprised about my own mind. For example, yesterday I remembered how to exit Vim without Googling.

HTML
CSS
PHP 7

Find my code on Github so you can judge me silently!
https://t.co/nbhAZOaZpd
Hooray! My soon-to-be-portfolio site is not empty anymore üéâ. You can now find another dad joke on there every single day.  Don't ask about my CSS skills.

https://t.co/HqZTSnGxL1
Authors note: it's a joke. 3 is an odd number.
Idk y'all. Web3 sounds kind of.... odd üëÄ
Just noticed that all my courses got listed for my second semester. I'm hopeful about learning a lot üòÅ https://t.co/NccA9dKysv
Remember that Twitter isn't real life. You can have 1 trillion followers on Twitter but to people that are not on here that fact doesn't matter.

Network. Offline &amp; online. Locally &amp; worldwide.
Sometimes I try something with JavaScript and I just can't get it to work.

Finally I switch to PHP and I get stuff done in 10 seconds üòÇ
Finished up my presentation for uni where I had to show off what I did the last 5 months at my internship. 

Got a 8 out of 10! ü•≥ I'm very happy.

Learn how to use a debugger if you get into backend development. Pleeeaaasse. 

It will save you so much time, frustration, and pain.
I started learning HTML &amp; CSS when I barely understood any English. I can remember being super frustrated about it back then.

We need more beginner-friendly coding tutorials in languages that are not English.

Everybody that puts effort into that is a hero in my eyes üôå
Why is the computer keyboard working so hard?

Because it has two shifts!
Idk why but we turn around the comma and dot here so it's ‚Ç¨218 and a couple of cents
Can I be excited about my first income thanks to Tech Twitter? Because I'm super excited! https://t.co/OEZkvfXZXl

‚≠ê Parttime web dev with a focus on C# and React
‚≠ê I love to share puns, motivational quotes and tech related posts

How was your weekend?
Happy reminder to sometimes take a break from staring at your PC / phone screen
I need your opinion.

Psssttt let me tell you a secret.
You won't become an amazing, successful developer just because you have the latest MacBook.
I'm going to spend my weekend with @CodingLeon in the woods. We booked an Airbnb and I'm excited to leave the big city for a little bit. https://t.co/TJAKJTHmb4
Nobody on tech twitter knows what they're doing. Not the people with 10 followers and not those with 100k followers.

Just share what you enjoy and be consistent about it
There are 10 types of people in this world. Those who know binary and those who don't.
The positive thing is that I can probably bring you all some good UI/UX content for the upcoming time. Going to focus on just that for 7 weeks.
I have to go back to uni in a little over 10 days. Which means I have to get out at 6 AM in the morning 4 days a week. 

üòë Someone please safe me
A lot of you ask me "can YOU buy ME a MacBook?" but nobody asks me "Can I buy YOU a MacBook?"

How to prep for an interview:

Another Twitter tip of the day:
Reply to people with their name.

Instead of saying 'congratulations!' say 'congratulations, Tom!'

That makes interaction feel way more personal and genuine.
Don't forget to make friends on Twitter!
Twitter becomes way more fun that way. 

Send someone a DM, especially someone with the same amount of followers as you, and send a message that's more than just 'hello' or 'hi'

I've been trying this a lot too lately and it's really fun

Because I picked the CS route doesn't mean I don't support people that do self-taught.

Please don't let anybody tell you what tech route is good for you because they're shouting "You can't get anywhere without a degree" or "You can be more succesful being self-taught"

Switch Statement

Last but not least, a switch statement is made in case you want to check a lot of conditions for one variable to keep it readable. 

The output for this switch statement is 'Off'. If the value was 3 then it would be 'Red'. https://t.co/HRwBTIR5Hk
Else if statement

Else if statements are interesting if you want multiple options. It acts like an extra check in your if-else code block.

In this example the if-else block now also checks on value 403 https://t.co/PjsZk1oR8c
Else statement

If you want to do something if a condition isn't true. You can use an else statement afterward. 

Take our last example, if the error would contain the value 403, it would run our new else statement instead. https://t.co/6KMKIHCtL1
Logical operators

There are some logical operators you can use for if statements.

'==' - equal to
'!=' - not equal to

'&gt;' bigger than
'&lt;' smaller than

'&gt;=' bigger or equal to
'&lt;=' smaller or equal to
What is an if statement?

An if statement is a logical code block that only gets taken care of if the condition is true. 

In this example, the message will be printed if the value is 404. If not, it will skip and print nothing. https://t.co/J44wjYhXoD

Enums

Enums are a special type of datatype that contains multiple constants. It's great for for example a card game where you only want hearts, spades, clubs, and diamonds. 

Once you give a variable with the enum name as datatype a value, it cannot be overwritten. https://t.co/tSRDJTqesK
Constants 

Constants are a special type of variable that can't be overwritten or altered. 

You can use this for values you don't want to have changed https://t.co/90Qari5CzP

variables can contain all types of value. They all have their own names

string (text)
integer (whole numbers)

A variable is a piece of space with a name where you can put a value in.

Trick 4 - Don't make variables too similar 

Every IDE has autocompletion. If you have variables that are very similar, it's going to happen that you pick the wrong variable to use. This is going to cost time if you don't notice.
Trick 3 - Make your variables pronounceable

It's very hard to discuss a variable called 'yymmdd43'. There are also developers out there that need to use screen readers. So make everyone's life a little bit easier by making your variables pronounceable
Don't use single-letter variables either. Not only because it's not meaningful, but also because it's going to be very hard to find in a bigger project.
Trick 2 - Make your variables meaningful

Give your variables clear meaningful names so you know what they do. Don't give your variable the name 'days', call it 'days_until_birthday' instead.
Trick 1 - Check the naming convention of your language

You can find the recommended naming format of the programming language by looking at the official documentation

It's best practice to always follow the naming convention format 
that's recommended for all your variables.

Check if your web application is still readable with a colour-blindness simulator. There's an extension for this called 'Let's get color blind' which I can't recommend enough.

Don't use buttons where you can't tell the difference between them if your website was in black and white. Always try to add some kind of text or icon to them to make it more clear. The same goes for similar images that have a function in your application or website.
Now for design:

Always check if the colour difference between foreground and background has enough contrast. You can do this by visiting a contrast checker (I prefer webAIM) online and putting your hex color codes in there to see if they pass.

https://t.co/aK3zgm4y6c
Another thing to implement is a description of an image to the alt attribute inside &lt;img&gt; tags. 

You would think that alt is only used when a picture can't load, but it's also great for screenreaders to explain what's going on in a picture!

https://t.co/nlJHsRyVqL
Let's start with code:

Always add a lang attribute to your HTML tag and put the language that your website is written in there, in case people want to use screenreaders.
