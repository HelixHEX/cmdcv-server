5) Heroku (https://t.co/BIJ67o8i7W)

This one's a bit more technical, but heroku is a hosting platform that supports most programming languages. I personally use heroku for most if not all, of my projects. 

A few include:
1. https://t.co/zOcx7LQHhT
2. https://t.co/K9dtm8wkLK
4) Softr io (https://t.co/JtsyrQ5ISg)

Softr io is an easy to use, drag and drop website builder. With a ton of integrations, you don't need to outsource your developer needs.  I built https://t.co/SzEb0C4Q1i using https://t.co/JtsyrQ5ISg
3) Bravo studio (https://t.co/9EnXILLJgi) 

Using your figma designs, bravo turns your designs into mobile apps. With a simple to use UI, you can also connect to Airtable as a database for your app. I used bravo to build my personal portfolio app
2) Nocodeapi (https://t.co/6pQy1uRBBC)

Are you tired of reading confusing and complicated API documentation? Nocodeapi is a marketplace where they provide plug and play options for popular API's. I use nocodeapi as an endpoint proxy for all my API servers to make them secure.
1) Airtable (https://t.co/pGYcLOLo62)

If you're looking for a simple to use database, Airtable is a great solution. I currently use Airtable with https://t.co/SzEb0C4Q1i

I'm doing this because I realized sometimes it's not always about making money. I came out here to build something impactful. 

The best part is right now I'm by myself and I haven't put any money towards it besides buying the domain and it'll continue that way for a while
So now that astracollab has officially launched, I've made all individual accounts free for life. You get full access to all features right now pretty much forever. 

Now how astracollab make money? Right now it won't not until I implement teams for businesses.

Day 9 of building AstraCollab

Updates:
- User count hasn't increased yet 
- All server requests require users to be logged in to increase security

Tasks for today:
- Continue building chat feature 
- Add email reminders for tasks and projects deadlines
Can you get funding for your startup if it's registered as an LLC?
In the end, it all comes down to whether or not you want a cofounder!
However, the pros outweigh the cons 

To name a few 
- You get to build it how you want 
- Full profits 
- You learn more as you grow the product, such as DevOps etc 
- no limitations on how you build it
- work at your own pace
As much as I'd hate to admit. 

Building a full stack SaaS product by yourself has its cons

Here are my main 2 so far 
- you handle everything yourself from customer support to marketing to bug fixes 
- can't bounce ideas with other people since your alone
Did some math and I might not be able to give away 100 accounts as originally planned, so it's now 50 pro accounts 

13 given away so far and it's all been positive feedback!
Day 8 of building astracollab

Updates:
- officially have 13 users now

3. After the first 100 and everything runs fine, add subscriptions for new users. First 100 get full access for free forever
It's always good to have future plans for whatever if is your building, so here are mine for astracollab

1. Build out the three core features  
- invite clients/other freelancers
- realtime chat
- freelance marketplace similar to like fiverr or upwork

It doesn't take much to make your first product. Start with the resources you have. If you don't know how to code there are bunch of no-code tools 

@bubble a popular one

Day 3 of building AstraCollab

- I can now officially say I have my first user on the platform!

- Working on changing the freelancer signup flow to accommodate differentiating between a freelancer and a client

- working on making the experience for inviting clients cleaner
https://t.co/8gzTgimLAZ

Chill vibes

hehe my most liked tweet https://t.co/GIUqURh4AZ
The end. /End
Everyone always asks me "oh how did you grow your twitter account so quickly" or like " what are your secrets" 

So here's a thread on how I grew my account from 539-540 followers in 1 month. Thread üßµ

Day 2 end of day update (sort of):

- I'm planning to name the platform "AstraCollab"
- Freelancers can now invite clients 
- I disabled inviting freelancers to keep things simple for now 
- Clients can now accept or decline project invites from freelancers
Who says I'm not 37???? https://t.co/39xxtfmFGw

@debsYJhill
What's a better name for a collaboration platform

(There was a typo with the old poll)
It's astra not astara****
I would really love to onboard the first user sometime this week or next week and see what other features to add/improve 

If you're down simply reply to this or DM me
What sets my platform apart is the relationship between the freelancer and the client. A key feature in development is a real-time chat that removes the need to give out personal info to communicate. 

Clients can also view the status of projects without asking "is it done"
If you're a freelancer who currently doesn't use a project management tool, I'd love to offer mine. It is still in the early stages so it may not be able to compete with the other larger platforms JUST YET, but it will get there.

In return, you get full access for free forever
Here's a short little sneak peek at the freelancer platform!

Im giving away the first 100 users full access forever as sort of a founders reward https://t.co/jZ83UZcpM5
If you're not using javascript to code, why code at all? https://t.co/c5LrX72lff
When my platform officially goes public I'll be updating my banner monthly to document MRR üòÅ
If any VC's follow me, im just wondering, does your SaaS product need to be registered as a company to receive funding.

PS.

New to all this so I've got no clue how VC's work
Day 2 of building my freelancer platform in public:

Yesterday I spent the day refactoring code to make it cleaner and run smoother

Today's task:
- Finishing adding client routes 
- test all routes 
- MAYBE start on the realtime chat page
LOWKEY might start offering web hosting services and make it free for high school students
I'm currently in a space right now and OMG it's crazy how much knowledge you don't know about when it comes to computer science
Now that twitter spaces is public should i remove it from my bio?
Hopefully my journey is like this as well. 

Documenting my journey from $0 MRR to my first $100 MRR and so forth! https://t.co/mXQHAyYTcP
What would you say is a reasonable price to pay for web hosting?
My boy fresh with it!!! https://t.co/zkt8WXhruO
Day 1:

Tasks for today:
- setup client routes
- prevent client from accessing freelancer routes 
- enable client invite links
@suiteasdesign 

A thread you might be interested in when you have the time
5/ what's the key takeaway from all this....take the time to really understand what it is your writing, it's purpose, and different ways to write what it does but with the same results. 

And use google, don't be afraid to look things up, that's how you learn and grow!
4/ and Promise.all() since I needed an asynchronous function to retrieve user profile images 

When I implemented the new code runtime dropped go around 300 ms to 500ms which is a significant change and data was loaded almost instantly on the frontend
3/ when I noticed how long it took to load data, I was like "Ayo this is too long for customers ü§£" so I went to the backend code and tried to figure ways to make it more efficient. 

That's when I came up with the idea to use a combination of https://t.co/Lk9jJcaU2Q
2/ In my backend api I had an endpoint that would iterate through an array using nested loops since multiple arrays coexistent within that one array. 

When the api was called from the frontend the response time was anywhere from 1.5 seconds to 2.5
Yesterday I think I finally realized what it means to write code and write efficient code. 

The main difference is one is focused on time it takes to compile, etc while the other is a more broad term. 

Here's how I came to the realization. Thread üßµ 1/
Success doesn't happen over night. It takes time. 

You also have to allow yourself to make mistakes, that's how you grow!
Day 0 end of day update:

Just rebuilt the task management page for the site working on deploying the code now
it‚Äôs been a while since i‚Äôve hosted a space
Should I do a founders reward for the first 100 people or more? Or less?
If snapchat doesn't give me this feature we're gonna a real problem. It's the only app I use that doesn't have dark mode https://t.co/vrOoZpBp8P
One thing I learned when it comes to building a product is constant innovation. 

Today I didn't like the feel and look of a certain page for a platform I'm building. Although it works fine, it's very buggy and the user experience as mediocre, so I decided to rip it apart
I'm starting a new series where I log what I'm working on in regards to the freelance platform
Day 0 of my freelance platform:

I haven't publicly released the url but I do have 1 user beta testing it out for me

Today's tasks:
- Redo the tasks page since it's very buggy
- restructure backend code to accommodate frontend changes 
- hopefully onboard another user
LOL 50/50 https://t.co/cOMS4lBbBc
If you're a freelancer would you be so kind to either DM or reply to this
@Billy_Ruecker 

You seem to know a lot of people ü§£. Do you happen to know anyone in marketing or have any tips yourself?
Hey #twittermarketing,

I'm like terrible at marketing products I build, but I am amazing at building said products. Any tips on how to bring users on a platform???
React tip::

If you don't want to use redux or mobx because of its complexity I recommend using https://t.co/pao4hXbv8z. It's lightweight and easy to get started with!
